Hello!
I've researched a new game mode!
There will be a total of 4 Impostors in each game,
Crewmate needs to dodge the Impostor and complete all missions to win.
Impostor can be destroyed
But Crewmate doesn't know who Impostor is,
When a Crewmate has done all the tasks,
This Crewmate can start a meeting,
Indicate what you think is Impostor,
If the player is Impostor, then nothing happens,
If the player is a Crewmate, the player who pointed out the player will be out
Do you understand? So let's get start!
